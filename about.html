			<p>
				Electronic Payplus Limited is a limited liability company registered by Corporate Affairs Commission in Nigeria. It carries on the business of card manufacturing and personalization. The bulky of its customers are commercial banks in Nigeria.   
			</p>

			<p>Personalization of ATM cards for banks including Polaris Bank Limited is one of its core activities. Personalization means “The encoding and embossing of card holder’s information on tracks of the magnetic stripe and the card surface respectively, and the encoding of the chip of the card”. Personalization involves use of Machineries which encode customers data on the card with the supervision of a worker who may not be a technical person.</p>

			<p>	We are writing therefore to seek clarification on Withholding Tax Rate applicable on Personalization service described above. Such clarification is highly important to bring disputed WHT rate between us and Polaris Bank Limited to conclusive end and FIRS is the final arbiter in this case. </p>
			<p class="dark"> It is pertinent to state however, that all our existing and current personalization invoices have always been subjected to 5% withholding tax by our customers until recently when Polaris Bank Limited came up to withhold at 10%.
			Various FIRS circulars on Withholding Tax have not assisted to interpret the appropriate rate applicable to Personalization service.
